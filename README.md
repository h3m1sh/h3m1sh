# Hi, I'm Hamish ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior full stack developer based in Auckland, New Zealand. I recently completed the Mission Ready Full Stack Developer Accelerator, where I built a fully functional prototype of the Z Energy Mobile App alongside an amazing team.

I enjoy creating real-world solutions with clean code, learning new tools, and collaborating with others.
